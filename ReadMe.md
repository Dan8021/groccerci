# Groccer
- Groccer aims to be a one stop solution to ease out tasks for both customers and grocery shop owners. Groccer forms a network of trusted, local shopkeepers to provide the products to the customers without the need for the system to establish physical shops.
- Groccer provides a salient feature for the customers to place an order for any product, this product request will be broadcasted to all the shops in vicinity (around 3km), this request will be accepted by any of the stores that have the stock sufficient to complete the requested order which will be delivered by any available delivery personnel assigned for that particular zipcode.
- The system will display a variety of products under multiple domains and will allow the user to search for particular items.
- Customers can also choose the delivery source for their particular request, if that particular is unable to complete the order, the system will prompt alternate options for order completion. Customers will be given a provision to report any faulty orders.
- Groccer also intends to provide a platform for shopkeepers to manage their inventory without -having to develop a custom system, they will be able to keep track of their available stock, their expiry dates, and the stock sold.
